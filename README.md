# Okta-Scripts
Collection of Scripts that leverage the okta powershell module

You'll need to install and configure the [Okta-PSModule] (https://github.com/mbegan/Okta-PSModule) before you can run these scripts.

I've included some basic notes within the scripts themselves, if you have questions ask here or within the [Okta Community] (support.okta.com/help/community).
